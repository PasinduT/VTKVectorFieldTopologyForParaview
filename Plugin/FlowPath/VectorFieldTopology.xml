          The Elevation filter generates point scalar values for an input data
          set along a specified direction vector. The Input menu allows the user
          to select the data set to which this filter will be applied. The Low
          Point and High Point define a line onto which each point of the data
          set is projected. The minimum scalar value is associated with the Low
          Point, and the maximum scalar value is associated with the High Point.
          The scalar value for each point in the data set is determined by the
          location along the line to which that point projects.

          The line can be specified interactively using the 3D line widget. See
          section 7.4 for more information about this widget.
